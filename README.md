<h3>Projects</h3>
<h4>Wellness Project</h4>
To develop this learning experience, my team and I conducted a needs analysis, utilizing the ADDIE model as a structured framework. We conducted interviews with  learners to identify knowledge gaps, skill deficiencies, and training objectives. These insights informed the design of the <a href= https://portfolium.com/entry/wellness-during-covid-19>learning experience <a/>, ensuring that it effectively addressed the identified needs.
